#### TODO
* Add data augmentation capabilities to preprocessing scripts
* Improve IQ for automatic tone-mapping algorithm via tuning for baseline
* Build jupyter notebook.

#### Pipeline
* Raw data, including HDR images.
* Python script that reads in data.
* Python script that manipulates data according to our specifications.

Run preprocessing on HDR dataset raws, generate baseline tone-mapped images:
```
./data-preprocess.py ../data/hdr_image_dataset ../data/proc_image_dataset/
```
